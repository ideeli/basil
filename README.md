## Installation

Basil is meant to be run from source. Ruby is interpreted, so there's 
not much technical difference to this approach.

It is recommended mainly because he expects `./plugins` and `./config` 
to exist and running from within a clone of this repo is the simplest, 
most transparent way to accomplish that.
